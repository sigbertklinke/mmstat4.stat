The hypergeometric distribution can be illustrated with a urn model. In the urn are white and black balls and <em>n</em> balls will be sampled without replacement. We have in total <em>N</em> balls (total amount of white and black balls) of which <em>M</em> are of one kind (here for example white). If we now draw <em>n</em> elements from the urn the hypergeometric distribution describes the probability that exactly <em>k</em> of these Elements are of the first kind (here white). In this example the total amount of black and white balls (<em>N</em>), the amount of white balls (<em>M</em>) and the numer of balls that will be sampled (<em>n</em>) can be manipulated.
