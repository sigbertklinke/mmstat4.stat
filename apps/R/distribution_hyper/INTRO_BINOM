The binomial distribution describes the number of successes in a sequence of <em>n</em> independent random experiments, which have only two possible outcome (success or no success). One random experiment that results a binomial distribution is the game of 'flipping a coin'. Expect a perfect coin whereas the probability to succeed (here head) is equal to the probability to not succeed (here tail), for both it is 50%. In the following example you may manipulate the probability of success per draw to result different outcomes.
