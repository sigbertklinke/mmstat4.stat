The Poisson distribution expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time (and/or space) if these events occur independently and with a known average rate. The parameter &lambda; describes this known average rate of events in the interval. One example is the number of lightning in a certain region. Assume that this average mean of the lightning is 2 (i.e. &lambda;=2), then the Poisson distribution gives the probability of <em>x</em> lightnings in that region. In this example you can manipulate &lambda;.
